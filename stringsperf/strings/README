Approaches for strstr and strtok

strstr:
  My approach was to iterate through the haystack and compare
  the needle to the haystack. I would start at different chars.
  If they were ever equal then I would retur the rest of the 
  haystack. If no needle is found return null.

strtok:
  My approach was to make sure that the input string wasn't null
  and that we weren't at a null save state. Next I found the 
  start delimiter in the input string and saved it. Then I 
  foudn the delimeter not in the save state and saved it.
  I then checked to see if the saved state equaled string.
  If it did, then I returned null. Now if the returned sate wasn't
  null, I would increment it by one. If it was then I set it to null.
  After that I would return the string that has been altered to the 
  correct instance.
