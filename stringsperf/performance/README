Performance

Known Bugs:
	The program seemed to pass if the iterator is greater than 100,000
	anythings less and it is pretty random if it passes or not

Notes: 
	I tried 4 accumulators first and decided to bump it up to 5.
	Didn't really see an improvement in performance though. Diminish return.

Implementation: 
	The key was to have 5 accumlators to allow for the addition to run in 
	parallel. So after defing 5 accumlators, I stepped through the for
	loop 5 increments at a time. And added and multipled up the values to a 
	specific acculator based of past values. After the for loop was
	done I needed to do some clean up depending on if the for highest degree
	was divisible by 5 or not. After that I summed up the accumlators for
	the final answer.
