common.c/h

The function fo common.c is to provided code that both generator.c and solver.c
both shared. 

Bugs: There are no known bugs.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

generator.c/h

The function of generator.c is to produce a maze of some size - deterimined by
the user. It randomly constructs this maze through the function of drunken_walk.
The function drunken_walk calls on shuffle_array and get_neighbor to help it 
accomlish the making part. 

Once the maze is constructed, the program saves it into a file - specified by 
the user. It will then use encode_maze to assign a hexidecimal number to every
room sustaining the connections betwen the rooms and outer wall.

Bug: There are no known bugs.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

solver.c/h

The function loads the maze from the hexidecimal format that it was saved in.
Once the connections are made for each room, the program then starts at a give
location and tries to make it to the goal location.

The path taken to reach the goal location is saved one of two ways: the full 
path with all the backtracking that took place or the prunned path which is 
a path wit no backtracking.

Bug: There is no check to make sure the dimensions of the parameters passed in
match the maze in the file.
