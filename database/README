How to interface with the program

SERVER
	./server <port>

	There is a loop for user input
	s - stops clients from sending things
	g - starts clients again
	p(\0) - print binary tree in terminal
	p txt (\n) - print binary tree into txt file

	CTR-C kills all clients
	CTR-D sends end of file thus killing the program

CLIENTS
	./client <servername> <port> [<script> <occurences>]

	Formatting script or user input
	a item - item is put into the database
	r item - item is removed from database

	CTR-C kills clients

Knowledge
	Database uses fine coarse locking to allow
	multiple clients to edit the binary tree

BUGS
	No none bugs

STUDENTS WORKED WITH
