Known Bugs: N/A

Run:
  Compile as usual with make
  The either run shell_prompt or shell_no_prompt with no arguments
    - if you do provide any arguments they will be ignored

Structure:
  The structure of my program is what was presented out in the hand out.
  1.  I took the input string and made all white spaces null.
  2.  I then found all redirects and redirect names
  3.  I then found the starting char of the rest of the strings
  4.  I compared the first string to know what operation to do
  5.  I then executed that string

Notes:
  I have pretty large buffers for the inputs by users, but I didn't
  want there to be a constraint.

  The Makefile doesn't save things like it is supposed to so it recompiles
  every time.
